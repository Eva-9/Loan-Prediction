**Project Overview**

Loan Prediction is a machine learning project designed to automate and streamline the loan approval process. By analyzing applicant information and historical data, this system predicts whether an applicant is eligible for a loan.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and applying log transformations for robust data preparation.

Model Selection: Evaluating multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and more.

Performance Evaluation: Utilizing K-fold cross-validation for model selection and hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search.

Pipeline for Efficiency: Constructing a streamlined data preprocessing and modeling pipeline for seamless loan eligibility assessment.
